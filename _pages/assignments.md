We'll be completing all assignments in R, so make sure you have both [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/).  We'll be using several packages from [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/).  To install a package for the first time, use

```
BiocManager::install("SNPRelate") # install the package SNPRelate, in quotes
```

Then to use the packae on any subsequent R session, simply run

```
library(SNPRelate) # no quotes
```
